# Google Project Management: Specialization Notes Part 1

by Medhat Omr

## Intro

I'm a computer engineer, and I spend a significant amount of my time managing
computer resources, such as CPU time, memory, and IO. Maybe this is the reason
I find this specialization very interesting to me, like the normal extension
for my job, where instead of CPU time, we have team time, instead of memory,
cash, and IO, we have budget and quality management, and so on.

I found that I can divide the specialization into four parts, three main ones
and a fourth optional one. The three main parts are: PM Foundation, PM phases
deep dive, and Agile mindset & methodology, while the fourth optional part is
PM as a career.
